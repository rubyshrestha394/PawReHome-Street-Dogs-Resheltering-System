# PawReHome

**PawReHome** is a community-based digital platform designed to tackle the growing issue of stray dog overpopulation in urban Nepal.  
It enables users to report stray dogs, adopt vaccinated pets, and support animal welfare initiatives through an integrated e-commerce marketplace.  

This project was developed as part of the B.Sc. CSIT program at **St. Xavier’s College, Maitighar, Kathmandu**.

## Overview
Urban Nepal faces increasing challenges with stray dog populations, causing welfare concerns and public health risks (e.g., rabies).  
**PawReHome** addresses this gap by providing:
- A **reporting system** for citizens to log stray dog sightings.
- A **digital adoption system** for rehoming vaccinated dogs.
- An **e-commerce module** to sell pet products, supporting sustainability.

## Problem Statement
- Lack of a centralized, transparent, and accessible system for street dog rescue and adoption.  
- Manual and uncoordinated methods used by municipalities and NGOs.  
- Growing health and safety risks in urban areas due to unmanaged stray populations.

## Objectives
1. Develop a reporting system for stray dog sightings with location details.  
2. Provide an adoption interface connecting citizens with vaccinated dogs.  
3. Create an e-commerce module for pet products with a secure payment gateway.
